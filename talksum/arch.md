Based on the contents of the `README.md` and `pyproject.toml`, the project seems to be a voice-to-text and text summarization application. Here's a high-level architecture to implement the goals of each step:

1. **Voice Recording Module (`record_voice.py`)**: This module will be responsible for recording voice data. It could have a function like `record_audio()` that starts recording and returns the path to the audio file.

2. **Speech-to-Text Module (`speech_to_text.py`)**: This module will convert the recorded voice to text. It could use a pre-trained model like Whisper. The main function could be `transcribe_audio(audio_path)`, which takes the path to an audio file and returns the transcribed text.

3. **Summarization Module (`summarize.py`)**: This module will summarize the transcribed text and extract names. It could use a GPT model for summarization. The main functions could be `get_summary(text)[ and ](file:///Users/dannyblessinger/Documents/talksum/talksum/talksum/README.md#12%2C85-12%2C85)extract_names(text)`, which take the transcribed text and return the summary and extracted names, respectively.

4. **Main Script (`main.py`)**: This script will bring together all the components. It will call the functions from the other modules to record the voice data, convert it to text, and summarize it.

Here's a potential architecture diagram:
